# Milestone 1 Report

---

## Objective

The objective of Milestone 1 was to understand the dataset and establish baseline methods for solving multiple-choice question answering using Natural Language Processing techniques.

---

## Dataset

The dataset consists of:

* Question prompt
* Five answer options (A, B, C, D, E)
* Correct answer label (training set)

The objective is to predict the three most probable answers for each question.

---

## Tasks Completed

* Loaded and explored the training dataset.
* Calculated the frequency distribution of answer labels.
* Computed the vocabulary size after preprocessing.
* Removed English stop words.
* Generated TF-IDF features.
* Calculated cosine similarity between prompts and answer options.
* Implemented a Majority Class baseline.
* Implemented a TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity baseline.
* Evaluated the models using MAP@3.

---

## Methods Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* TF-IDF Vectorizer
* Cosine Similarity

---

## Evaluation Metric

The baseline models were evaluated using Mean Average Precision at 3 (MAP@3), which measures how highly the correct answer is ranked among the top three predictions.

---

## Outcome

Milestone 1 established baseline methods and provided an understanding of the dataset, preprocessing pipeline, TF-IDF representation, cosine similarity, and the MAP@3 evaluation metric.
